<h1>Welcome to my page</h1>
<p class= "subHead">My summer project is about healthcare services.</p>
<h2>The Goal</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to create a "diagnosis database". This is a database in which symptoms a patient is feeling can be entered and a diagnosis will be given. Along with the diagnosis, a treatment is provided as well.This database will take the imputed symptoms and produce the most logical diagnosis and treatment for said diagnosis in a matter of seconds. </p>
<h2>The Dream</h2>
<p>One day I hope to successfully create and implement this project into the medical field. This dream database could not only speed up the diagnosis process but also reduce the number of wrongful diagnosis and treatment cases.</p>
