<h1>Welcome to my page</h1>
My summer project is about healthcare services.
<h2>Info</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to create a "diagnosis database". This is a database in which symptoms a patient is feeling can be entered and a diagnosis will be given. Along with the diagnosis, a treatment is provided as well.</p>
