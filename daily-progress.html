<h1> Daily Progress</h1>
 <h2 class= "day1"> Day 1</h2>
 <p> Today is the first day of my project. I did not get much done today because I had many computer problems. Other than that, I learned a new program (git and github) and used it to create a basic webpage describing my intentions for my sumer project. When adding to my project I tried to add an href and realized that I could not because it is not local. After using it I could not push or pull work on github. However I fixed the issue.</p>
 <h2 class="day2">Day 2</h2>
 <p> Today I officially started on my project. I created the first part of my project where symptoms along with basic paitent information can be entered and sumbitted. Now I have to create a page to process that information so that a diagnosis can be recieved. To do that I started watching tutorials and using samles to gain experience with AngularJS. After I learn AngularJS I will be able to finish my Diagnosis Database.
 <h2 class="day3">Day 3</h2>
 <p>Today I spent the work day working on angularJS. Using w3schools I learned expressions, directives, and model. I also worked with modules, however I am still need more time in that area. Overall, I felt I made great progress with angularJS today and I am understanding it much better.</p>
